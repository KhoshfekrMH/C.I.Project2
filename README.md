# What is project about? ðŸ¤”
My Universiy Project with 3 part problems and it is about KNN , SVM and f1Score

# Problems 1
if we have :

```
import numpy as np

mean1 = np.array([2.5, .25])

cov1 = np.array([[1, .75],
                 [.75, 1]])

mean2 = np.array([-1.5, 0])

cov2 = np.array([[2, .5],
                 [.5, 2]])
```

then:

1) A: Make 70 traning sample from class 1 and 300 training sample from class 2 and then train KNN and calculate Accuracy and F1-Score
2) B: Make 100 traning sample from class 1 and 100 training sample from class 2 and then train KNN and calculate Accuracy and F1-Score
3) A: Calculate SVM , Accuracy and F1-Score with dataFrame created at part1
4) B: Calculate SVM , Accuracy and F1-Score with dataFrame created at part2
5) By using the above result, compare the impact of balenced and non-balenced datas sets on two SVM and KNN aggregates
